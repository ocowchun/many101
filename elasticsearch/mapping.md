### index
The index attribute controls how the string will be indexed. It can contain one of three values:

`analyzed`
First analyze the string and then index it. In other words, index this field as full text.

`not_analyzed`
Index this field, so it is searchable, but index the value exactly as specified. Do not analyze it.

`no`
Donâ€™t index this field at all. This field will not be searchable.

The default value of index for a string field is `analyzed`.
